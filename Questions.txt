1. Write a Python program to get a string made 
of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given 
a string. If the string length is less than 2, 
return instead of the empty string. 
Go to the editor

Sample String : 'assignment'
Expected Result : 'asnt'			the lyric is not so poor
Sample String : 'as'				a=lst.index('not')
Expected Result : 'asas'			b=lst.index('poor')
						
Sample String : ' a'
Expected Result : Empty String

2. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, 
if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string. Go to the editor
Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
'The lyrics is poor!'
Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
'The lyrics is poor!'
